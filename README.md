# This is the readme file #

This repository contains image analysis scripts that were used in the "Cell adhesion and spreading on fluid membranes through microtubules-dependent mechanotransduction" paper. Each script has an associate folder with example images that can be used to test the script.

## Script names (manual and automatic thresholdings) ##

This script takes a multi-channel image of cells adhered on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) as in input. The following channels of the input image should be identified by the user: brightfield, integrin and SLB.

The script provides two segmentations as an output. First, it asks the user to segment cells (manually) using a polygone tool in the brightfield channel in ImageJ. Second, for each segmented cell it detects clusters in the integrin channel. This segmentation is performed automatically by either setting up the threshold value or using the "RÃ©nyi Entropy" theshold algorithm. 

Both segmentations (cells and integrin clusters) are quantified with ImageJ. The results are incrementied in the .csv file.
