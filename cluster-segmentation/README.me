# Cluster detection with manual and automatic thresholdings #

This script takes a multi-channel image of cells adhered on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) as in input. The following channels of the input image should be identified by the user: brightfield, integrin and SLB.

The script provides two segmentations as an output. First, it asks the user to segment cells (manually) using a polygone tool in the brightfield channel in ImageJ. Second, for each segmented cell it detects clusters in the integrin channel. This segmentation is performed automatically by either setting up the threshold value or using the "Rényi Entropy" theshold algorithm. 

Both segmentations (cells and integrin clusters) are quantified with ImageJ. The results are incrementied in the .csv file.
